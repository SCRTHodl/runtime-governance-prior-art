# Governance Continuity

This document operationalizes the continuity principles described in paper.pdf and the associated provisional filings.
The paper is explanatory. This document is normative.

## Invariant

Governance authority is independent of any specific model, toolchain, runtime, or vendor.

## Continuity Guarantees

Authority policies, admission rules, and revocation semantics persist across:

- Model replacement
- Toolchain changes
- System migration
- Runtime upgrades
- Vendor substitution

Execution substrates may change.
Governance authority does not.

## Conformance Requirement

Any execution environment must prove conformance to the active governance ruleset prior to being granted authority to operate.

## Non enabling Notice

This document is normative and non implementational.
It describes constraints and expected behavior, not mechanisms, algorithms, key material, configuration, or system designs.
