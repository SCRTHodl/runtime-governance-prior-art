# Authority Admission Layer

This document operationalizes the authority principles described in paper.pdf.
The paper is explanatory. This document is normative.

## Invariant

Authority must be admitted before any externally effective action or internal state mutation.

No execution, tool use, external side effect, learning, or state change may occur unless authority has been explicitly admitted for the specific context, intent, and action.

## Admission Requirements

Authority admission is:

- Explicit (never implicit, never inferred)
- Scoped (context, intent, capability)
- Time bounded (has an expiry)
- Revocable (can be rescinded at any execution boundary)
- Verifiable (absence of verifiable authority is disqualifying)

Authority may be represented by receipts, tokens, signed assertions, or other verifiable artifacts. The representation is implementation defined.

## Denial Rule

If authority is absent, expired, revoked, or unverifiable, execution is denied.

## Separation From Runtime Safety

Runtime safety, monitoring, degradation, observability, and post hoc audit mechanisms operate only after authority has been granted.
They do not substitute for authority admission.

## Non enabling Notice

This document is normative and non implementational.
It describes constraints and expected behavior, not mechanisms, algorithms, key material, configuration, or system designs.
